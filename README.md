BPM Generator for Analog Synths

This project is unfinished.

Some improvements on the LED display are required: It draws too much current (needs some multiplexing).

The frequency is set with the potentiometer. Depending on its position, some jiggle can occur.

Component count is a bit high and could be reduced.
